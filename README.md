Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Andra, a frontend developer focusing on React, TypeScript, and JavaScript.

Welcome to my Dev Lab! It's an experimental place where I learn and play âœ¨ I used to be a chemical engineer but switched careers in 2020. So, instead of conducting experiments in a chemical lab, I now run experiments here ðŸ˜Š

Here, you'll mainly find my initial baby steps as a developer ðŸ‘£ While those steps were clumsy at first, they were also the most important ones that introduced me to the fascinating world of programming ðŸŒŒ My bigger steps are in private repositories and, unfortunately, cannot be made public.
